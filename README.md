This is the repo with the code to run the Bolivia ALICE Validation interface.

For annotation purposes: the relevant script is either `boliviaValid8.py` or `boliviaValid8-separate.py` (if multiple people want to work on separate IDs).

Directions for annotators:
1. Go ahead and download the script `boliviaValid8.py` or `boliviaValid8-separate.py` on a machine that has python / anaconda installed.
2. Make sure your BoxDrive on your laptop has the folder `alice_chopped_clips`
3. Open Terminal and enter `cd <LINK TO FOLDER WHERE SCRIPT WAS DOWNLOADED>`
3. Now run the following command `python <NAME OF .PY SCRIPT> <LINK TO FOLDER alice_chopped_clips FROM BOX> <YOUR NAME HERE>` (remember to enter your name exactly like this, every time you return to this app). For example, if my name were schwa, I would run `python boliviaValid8-separate.py /Users/schwa/Box/alice_chopped_clips schwa`
4. Start annnotating!
5. Remember to hit "save and next" after every clip
6. Do not edit or delete any other files which might be created in your Box folder.
